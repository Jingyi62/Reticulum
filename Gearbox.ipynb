    "To emulate the outcomes of the Gearbox system, we instantiate a network comprising 5000 nodes, with a portion represented by $P_a$ being designated as adversarial. These adversarial nodes are distributed randomly within the network. Nodes are subsequently assigned to shards through a random allocation process. We then assess each shard to determine whether the percentage of adversarial nodes exceeds the shard's predefined liveness threshold. In cases where this threshold is surpassed, we dissolve the existing shard and construct a new one with a higher gear setting. This process is iteratively executed until all shards maintain a percentage of adversarial nodes that falls below their respective liveness thresholds. There are five gears corresponding to the liveness threshold of $10\\%$, $20\\%$, $25\\%$, $30\\%$ and $49\\%$. We repeat this entire procedure 1000 times, observing the distribution of shards across different gear configurations."

    "In our paper, we also take into account the latency incurred when disseminating data, and we model this latency as linearly proportional to the number of nodes involved. To ensure the time-bound for shard-related activities is greater than the latency incurred during message transmission, we've established a relationship that satisfies $l = 2.12x$ where $x$ represents the number of nodes within the shard. Note that this estimation does not consider the potential slowdown when a node is in multiple shards and have multiple workload in parallel.  $2.12$ is chosen base on the fact that Rapidchain would be able to generate a block and conduct one round of voting that involves $329$ nodes in a shard within $698s$, which is measured in runtime in the same experiment environment for Reticulum and Rapidchain. Consequently, the time-bound for block generation and the subsequent voting rounds are set at $55.12s$, $82.68$, $106s$, $133.56s$, and $621.16s$, corresponding to the various shard sizes in different gears. This approach ensures that the time intervals are both consistent with the Gearbox paper's principles and suitably adjusted to account for the latency incurred in our specific context.\n"
