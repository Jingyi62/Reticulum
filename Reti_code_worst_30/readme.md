# Reticulum: A Two-Layer Blockchain Sharding Protocol

### V 0.1.2

#### Note!

**This version of the code is currently being developed and improved. It is specifically designed for conducting comparative experiments and should not be used in real commercial applications as it may have some imperfections. Its purpose is to gather insights and data for further enhancements and optimizations before considering it for production environments.**

**If you aim to replicate the results of the experiments, we suggest utilizing a high-performance server to accommodate a larger number of nodes. However, if your intention is to gain a basic understanding of Reticulum's functionality, deploying around ten nodes would be a suitable option. Keep in mind that the specific hardware and server specifications can impact the performance and scalability of the system. It's important to consider these factors when setting up your parameters.**
